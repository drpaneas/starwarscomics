# Timeline

#### Star Wars: Darth Maul

[![Star Wars: Darth Maul](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510bphHo-gL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Darth-Maul-ebook/dp/B074WH8D18/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

This is a 6-issue limited series which focuses on the origins of the Sith lord **Darth Maul**. It's a dark, powerful and fun story. This story probably takes places within the years of *The Phantom Menace* and probably at the same time as *Yoda's Secret War*.

#### Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace

[![Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61223kPY5wL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Episode-Phantom-Menace/dp/1302900749/ref=sr_1_2?s=books-intl-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1521678636&sr=1-2&keywords=star+wars+the+phantom+menace&dpID=61K14YsO1xL&preST=_SY264_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

#### Star Wars: Obi-Wan and Anakin

[![Star Wars: Obi-Wan and Anakin](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hLWxUYL6L.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Obi-Wan-Anakin/dp/078519679X/ref=pd_sim_14_51?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=3EFH16J9DA70W4QRZVRR)

This is a 5 part Limited Series, which bridges the gap between Episode I and Episode II. It shows Anakin's adventures and Anakin's Jedi training. It's a quite good story and the events are happening a few months before the Episode II. It's a fun to read comic and it's worth knowing the friendship between those two.

#### Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones

[![Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51AWOgwl1FL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Episode-Attack-Clones-ebook/dp/B01KN37QLY/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1521679064&sr=8-1)

#### Star Wars: Jedi of the Republic - Mace Windu

[![Star Wars: Jedi of the Republic - Mace Windu](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2BqCdUET6L.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Jedi-Republic-Windu-ebook/dp/B0794JB831/ref=pd_sim_351_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=FSCHHG7JDE7GNQVZ2G1Y)

This is another 5 part Limited Series and it takes part a little bit after Episode II. It shows how Jedi Knights are struggling with their new role after the Clone War.

#### Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Film 1-6 Seasons)

#### Star Wars: Darth Maul - Son of Dathomir

[![Star Wars: Darth Maul - Son of Dathomir](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xAbzENCSL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Darth-Maul-Dathomir/dp/1302908464/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1521679321&sr=1-1)

It's a 4 part Limited Series. This was actually a Dark Horse series, but this originally written as Clone War episode. This is the series that travels from the old EU to the new EU.

#### Star Wars: Kanan Vol. 2: First Blood

[![Star Wars: Kanan Vol. 2: First Blood](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DFHEheUHL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Kanan-First-Padawan-ebook/dp/B01ETWG72E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1521679489&sr=1-1)

This might be the 2nd Volume, but it's a Prequel to the 1st Volume (lol). This one shows Kanan's first adventure as a Jedi in the Clone War.

#### Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith

[![Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51l-XMKQXjL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Episode-Revenge-Sith-ebook/dp/B01N06MA7U/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1521679628&sr=1-3)

#### Star Wars: Kanan Vol. 1: The Last Padawan

[![Star Wars: Kanan Vol. 1: The Last Padawan](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a8A-Ic0-L.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B016P8AW6C/ref=series_rw_dp_sw)

It spans 5 issues and this tells the story of his last adventure during the Clone War.

#### Star Wars: Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith Vol. 1: Imperial Machine

[![Star Wars: Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith Vol. 1: Imperial Machine](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51TLVIVVlWL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Darth-Imperial-Machine-ebook/dp/B076C129TM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

This is the first *arc* of the 2nd Darth Vader on going series. It follows right after Episode III. It follows Anakin Skywalker transistion into Darth Vader. This series absolutely spectalurar and it blends the sequel with the original prequel. This feels perfectly the gap between the two trilogies.

#### Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith Vol. 2: Legacy's End

[![Star Wars: Darth Vader - Dark Lord of the Sith Vol. 2: Legacy's End](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HYcQf60nL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Darth-Vader-Legacys/dp/130290745X)

This includes the second volume which is called **The Dying Light** and also the third volume called **The Rule of Five**. This is an ongoing series, so expect more.

This is a lot of fun and takes seconds after the return of the Jedi. Focuses on Poe Dameron's parents. It's not the strongest one, but it's nice to see what happens after the death of the Emperor and Darth Vader.

#### Star Wars Special: C-3PO

[![Star Wars Special: C-3PO](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UJFR88CsL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Star-Wars-Special-C-3PO-2015-ebook/dp/B01D8ZT0ZO/ref=sr_1_4?s=books-intl-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1521677073&sr=1-4&keywords=Star+Wars+C-3PO&dpID=61UJFR88CsL&preST=_SY445_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)
